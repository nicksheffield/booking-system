Two versions of the site, whether you are an admin or not.

Guest
	Can login, or register self with enrollment code

Student (non-admin)
	Can do three main things:
		If no bookings already made, then you can make a booking.
			Making a booking includes setting dates for pick up and drop off,
			then choosing the individual products they want to get.
		If a booking has been made, you can view this booking, in a mobile friendly fashion (also print friendly)
		You can always view past bookings
		
Staff (admin)
	Can do three main things
		Can book out units against themself. These bookings do not have a due date.
		Handle a return.
			Units are marked off. You can put notes about damage etc.
			It should also be possible to mark a partial return.
		Handle site data.
			This includes creating/modify/delete class_types, classes, product_types, products, units and permissions.
			
The site also automatically emails students every day that their equipment is overdue.

Bookings not delivered by the end of the day are cancelled.

There is a concept of late fees.
	Students with due late fees are prevented from booking.
	Staff can easily see which students have the due late fees.
	Staff can also alter or waive a students fees.
	"Late fees should be recorded and payment could perhaps produce a receipt?" - not sure
