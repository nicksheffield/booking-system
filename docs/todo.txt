Todo.txt

	- Edit/Create/Delete users in angular from admin
	- Figure out datefmt stuff for editing date inputs
	- Students need to be confirmed
	- Add photos to products
	- When you delete, have the server send back an undelete url
		- then display this in a timed message that the user can use to undo
	- Dont reveal other users info in any requests when you are a student
	- Handle page headers and their buttons more gracefully whenever the title is too long
	- Replace select menus with combo boxes where applicable
	- Reset users passwords
	- Add some managerial features for staff where applicable
	- Make all id's randomly generated, not sequential (auto_increment)
	- Remove all the \t and \n from the app.min.js
	- Users can edit themselves
	- Maybe max quantity of a product PER GROUP
	- Waiting list for students that want to book a certain product
	- Maybe switch to using just email address for logging in, and refer to a user by their first name
	- An idea: maybe "invalidate" the arrays in $store somehow, and reload them whenever they get accessed next. That way you don't need to re-request every time you go to like the units page or whatever and risk getting stale data
	- Figure out how promises work ($q?) so I can remove those stupid _.find()'s within .$promise.then() blocks
	
Bugs

	- Sometimes the allowed_products page saves as soon as you load it, and wipes quantites
		- Think this is solved
