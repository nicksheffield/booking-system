Todo.txt

	- Edit/Create/Delete users in angular from admin
	- Students need to be confirmed
	- When you delete, have the server send back an undelete url
		- then display this in a timed message that the user can use to undo
	- Dont reveal other users info in any requests when you are a student
	- Handle page headers and their buttons more gracefully whenever the title is too long
	- Replace select menus with ui.select where applicable
	- Reset users passwords
	- Add some managerial features for staff where applicable
	- Make all id's randomly generated, not sequential (auto_increment)
	- Users can edit themselves
	- Waiting list for students that want to book a certain product
	- The $store service is getting too big, think of how to break it up
	- Modify groups to add/remove tutors
	- Tutor needs to be settable for new group and edit group
	- Change $store.invalidate() so it either takes 1 string or 1 array of strings, instead of this weird arguments thing I've got at the moment.
	- Add a chevron to ui.select
	
	- Ask graeme if bookings should have times
		- he said sort of
