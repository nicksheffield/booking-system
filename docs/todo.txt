Todo.txt

	- Waiting list for students that want to book a certain product
	- add tutor dropdown for classes can be cut off because the .frame or something has overflow hidden
	- Late fee restricts booking and that shows on user data
	- Student can request to extend the return date of any issued bookings
	- Only load bookings when needed, because they're basically the only thing that is going to grow insanely
	- Homepage info
	- Students viewing their own booking don't see their own name, because that was found in $store.users and we don't load that for students. Same thing with unit numbers
	- An improved filter on the booking page
		- Maybe a way to filter not by just closed, but by all priorities
		- Dropdowns for narrowing down group and user, and don't store that in url
			- When following a link to the booking page to filter user or group, maybe quickly set localStorage first
	- Move the make booking page's date and user fields to the confirm page so that all you do is pick products

	- Main Features to finish
		- Password Resets
		- Large amounts of bookings performance
		- Can't book overbooked products
			- Booking Make and Edit have two columns
				- Total quantity of product
				- Available (not currently booked in this time frame)
	
Late stuff
	- Reset users passwords
	- Students need to be confirmed
